Common Computer Usage
---------------------

- Management - Input, store, transfer, output
- Analysis - Search, machine learning, solvers

Design synthesis
----------------

> As engineering artifacts grow in complexity, we need to offload some design decisions to the computer. We need the computer to help us synthesize many of the minute details in our engineering devices as well as ensure high performance by searching among a myriad alternatives for the optimal combination of building blocks and parameter values [1]

Context-free Grammars

Language Hierarchy
==================

- Regular - Can be recognized finite state automata
- Context-free - Can be recognized by pushdown automata
- Recursively enumerable - Can be recognized by Turing machine
